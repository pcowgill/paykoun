  * Using this function you can collect all workers classes that has been defined

  * It will ignore any non-worker module.

  * *Note* On second thought, I don't really like the idea of this function, the reason
  *         being the only way to ensure a file is a worker is by running it. I am not confortable
          with the idea of running any file in a directory. It is not elegant and it is insecure too. 
          I prefere that we only use 'PaykounContext.addWorker'. There might be a way to register a worker easily
          Like we are currently doing using an index.js file
